These are the pre installed rules in the snort, we are just trying to explore them and find out why they are how they are.
we will go one by one and traverse the each rule, there syntax, properties etc....

All naming convention can be seen in  Snort-Rules/Glossary

1. alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"ATTACK-RESPONSES directory listing"; \
flow:established; content:"Volume Serial Number"; classtype:bad-unknown; sid:1292; rev:9;)
  it's an alert action,    on TCP protocol,    packet is from home network,    from any port,    to external network,    to any port,
  now the message will be displayed "ATTACK-RESPONSES directory listing" ,    flow:established means connetction is established to the source.
  content in packet should be "Volume Serial Number",    type of bad-unknown, it's predefined rule so sid >1000000,    revised 9 times
