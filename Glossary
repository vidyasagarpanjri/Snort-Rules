There are 5 available default actions in Snort, alert, log, pass, activate, and dynamic. In addition, if you are running Snort in inline mode,
you have additional options which include drop, reject, and sdrop [copied from snort manual page 183]

logging mode: IDS mode
1. alert : to give just a msg if a rule condtion it true (generate an alert using the selected alert method, and then log the packet)
2. log : write the packet to file, save to future (log the packet)
3. pass : let the packet to pass through
4. activate : passive action, it alerts and then trun on other rules (alert and then turn on another dynamic rule)
5. dynamic : secondary rule some other rules will call them, mainly activate (remain idle until activated by an activate rule , then act as a log rule)

inline mode: IPS mode
6. drop : block and log the packet, just drop no reply to source.
7. reject : block, log, then send the reset reply, if protocal is TCP and unreachable to ICMP protocol. we handle the dropping of packet.
8. sdrop :block the packet and forget it, no log for these action. risky we can loose the information 

We should use all these action very carefull and where they are needed, misplace action can result in huge storage use, loss of packets etc...
