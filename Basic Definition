Snort is a IDS \ IPS service.

How to detect any anomolies:
    a. check if the IP is known ?
    b. if the ports used are standard or known
    c. If there is suspicious in the data stream.
    d. add more if you find anything new.
  tools to use:
   use nmap to scan the home_net range, because you should not have loose ends.
   
   Naming convention is most important in snort. As it will help us to identify the rules, alrets and to scale the forece.
