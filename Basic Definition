Snort is a IDS \ IPS service.

How to detect any anomolies:
    a. check if the IP is known ?
    b. if the ports used are standard or known
    c. If there is suspicious in the data stream.
    d. add more if you find anything new.
  tools to use:
   use nmap to scan the home_net range, because you should not have loose ends.
   
   Naming convention is most important in snort. As it will help us to identify the rules, alrets and to scale the forece.

Snort rules can be divided into 2 sections 
    a. header : it contains rules action, protocol, source IP and destination IP, source ports and destination port and netmask.
    b. rule options : it contains alert messagses , directios like what sould be searches and looked for and how. like if then else condition.
 like e.g form snort manual page 182
    alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.0/24 111 (content:"|00 01 86 a5|"; msg:"mountd access";)
    
    alert -> rules action what action should be taken if condition is true.
    tcp -> protocol to looked for
    any -> any source IP
    any -> any source port
    
    "->" it can be looked as connetor or symbol for relation.
    
    192.168.1.0/24 -> destination IP range
    111 -> destination port
    
    () -> rule actions 
    content:"|00 01 86 a5|"; -> data in hex will be looked in the packet content.
    msg:"mountd access"; -> this message will be given if the condition is true.
