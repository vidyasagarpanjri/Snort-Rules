Snort is a IDS \ IPS service.

How to detect any anomolies:
    a. check if the IP is known ?
    b. if the ports used are standard or known
    c. If there is suspicious in the data stream.
    d. add more if you find anything new.
  tools to use:
   use nmap to scan the home_net range, because you should not have loose ends.
   
   Naming convention is most important in snort. As it will help us to identify the rules, alrets and to scale the forece.

Snort rules can be divided into 2 sections 
    a. header : it contains rules action, protocol, source IP and destination IP, source ports and destination port and netmask.
    b. rule options : it contains alert messagses , directios like what sould be searches and looked for and how. like if then else condition.
 like e.g form snort manual page 182
    alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.0/24 111 (content:"|00 01 86 a5|"; msg:"mountd access";)
    
    alert -> rules action what action should be taken if condition is true.[you can create a custom rule type]
    tcp -> protocol to looked for, [TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IP supported protocol]
    any -> any source IP[ we can club several IPs and ranges like [1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2/27] we can negate them !1.1.1.1 or ![1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2/27]]
    any -> any source port [negarion can be used like !80, we can set a range like 1:1000, 1: and :65000 ofcource there negations ]
    
    "->" it can be looked as connetor or symbol for relation. there is a bidirectional operator also "<>", there is no "<-"
    
    192.168.1.0/24 -> destination IP range
    111 -> destination port
    
    () -> rule actions 
    content:"|00 01 86 a5|"; -> data in hex will be looked in the packet content.
    msg:"mountd access"; -> this message will be given if the condition is true.
