#Physical Network Layer : it defines hardware specifications.
#Data Link Layer: responsible to for transmission of data in a network. like sending data to nodes in a Lan. 
#                  it can also detect and correct the error in data frame,
#          sub layer : media access control 
#                      framing is frame synchronization, whenever a bit slip occur(loss of data bit).
#                      sender and reciver must resync again in order to carry out transmission according to protocol.
#                      it can be using frame bit after every transmission or based on words like STX and ETX 
                     

ARP:
The address resolution protocol (arp) is a protocol used by the Internet Protocol (IP) [RFC826], 
specifically IPv4, to map IP network addresses to the hardware addresses used by a data link protocol. 
The protocol operates below the network layer as a part of the interface between the OSI network and OSI link layer.
    Who has 192.168.1.103?  Tell 192.168.1.254 Broadcast
    192.168.1.103 is at xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx 
    IP to MAC
    
RARP: 
Reverse ARP    : MAC to IP 

ICMP :
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a supporting protocol in the Internet protocol suite. 
It is used by network devices, including routers, to send error messages and operational information indicating, 
for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.

IP :  header size 20 
The Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing hosts, encapsulating data into datagrams 
(including fragmentation and reassembly) and routing datagrams from a source host to a destination host across one or more IP networks.
For these purposes, the Internet Protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system.

DNS : Domain Name System resolve domain name to IP, over UDP, 

HTTP
