#Data Link Layer: responsible to for transmission of data in a network. like sending data to nodes in a Lan. 
#                  it can also detect and correct the error in data frame,
#          sub layer : media access control 
#                      framing is frame synchronization, whenever a bit slip occur(loss of data bit).
#                      sender and reciver must resync again in order to carry out transmission according to protocol.
#                      it can be using frame bit after every transmission or based on words like STX and ETX 
                     

ARP:
The address resolution protocol (arp) is a protocol used by the Internet Protocol (IP) [RFC826], 
specifically IPv4, to map IP network addresses to the hardware addresses used by a data link protocol. 
The protocol operates below the network layer as a part of the interface between the OSI network and OSI link layer.

    192.168.1.103 is at xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx 
    IP to MAC
    
RARP: 
Reverse ARP    : MAC to IP 

ICMP :
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a supporting protocol in the Internet protocol suite. 
It is used by network devices, including routers, to send error messages and operational information indicating, 
for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.

IP :  header size 20 
The Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing hosts, encapsulating data into datagrams 
(including fragmentation and reassembly) and routing datagrams from a source host to a destination host across one or more IP networks.
For these purposes, the Internet Protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system.

DNS : Domain Name System resolve domain name to IP, over UDP, 

HTTP

TCP :
maximum transmission unit (MTU):
A maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the largest size packet or frame, specified in octets (eight-bit bytes), 
that can be sent in a packet- or frame-based network such as the Internet. The Internet's Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
uses the MTU to determine the maximum size of each packet in any transmission.

TTL: Time to live
Time to live (TTL) or hop limit is a mechanism that limits the lifespan or lifetime of data in a computer or network. 
TTL may be implemented as a counter or timestamp attached to or embedded in the data. 
Once the prescribed event count or timespan has elapsed, data is discarded.

ID: Identification field (IP ID)
The Identification field (IP ID) of the IPv4 header identifies which fragments constitute a datagram,when fragmented datagrams
are reassembled. The IPv4 specification does not specify exactly how this field is to be assigned values, only that each packet 
should get an IP ID that is unique for the source-destination pair and protocol for the time during which the datagram 
(or any of its fragments) could be alive in the network.

IpLen: Header Length 
As long as no options are present in the IP header, the header length is constant and well known.

Flags:
4.2.4.  Flags

   o  ECN-E (Explicit Congestion Notification):'1' to echo CE bit in IP header. It will be set in several consecutive headers 
      (until 'acknowledged' by CWR).  If ECN nonces are used, then there will be a 'nonce-sum' (NS) bit in the flags,as well.
      Again, transparency of the reserved bits is crucial for future-proofing this compression scheme.  
      From an efficiency/compression standpoint, the NS bit will either be unused (always '0') or randomly changing.

   o  CWR (Congestion Window Reduced):'1' to signal congestion window reduced on ECN.  It will generally be set in individual packets.  The flag will be set once per loss
      event.  Thus, the probability of its being set is proportional to the degree of congestion in the network, but it is less likely to
      be set than the CE flag.
   o  ECE (Echo Congestion Experience): If 'congestion experienced' is signaled in a received IP header,this is echoed through the ECE bit in segments sent by the
      receiver until acknowledged by seeing the CWR bit set.  Clearly,in periods of high congestion and/or long RTT, this flag will
      frequently be set to '1'.
   o  URG (Urgent Flag):'1' to indicate urgent data (which is unlikely with any flag other than ACK).
   o  ACK (Acknowledgement):'1' for all except the initial 'SYN' packet.
   o  PSH (Push Function Field) : Generally accepted to be randomly '0' or '1'.  However, it may be biased more to one 
      value than the other (this is largely caused by the implementation of the stack). 
   o  RST (Reset Connection):'1' to reset a connection (unlikely with any flag other than ACK).
   o  SYN (Synchronize Sequence Number):'1' for the SYN/SYN-ACK, only at the start of a connection.
   o  FIN (End of Data: FINished) :'1' to indicate 'no more data' (unlikely with any flag other than ACK)
