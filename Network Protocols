Physical Network Layer : it defines hardware specifications.
Data Link Layer: responsible to for transmission of data in a network. like sending data to nodes in a Lan. 
                  it can also detect and correct the error in data frame,
          sub layer : media access control 
                      framing is frame synchronization, whenever a bit slip occur(loss of data bit).
                      sender and reciver must resync again in order to carry out transmission according to protocol.
                      it can be using frame bit after every transmission or based on words like STX and ETX
